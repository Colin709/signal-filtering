# signal-filtering
(TO BE) Implemented in this repository:
  - Take user input and load a sampled signal
  - Calculate the sampling rate
  - design a lowpass/highpass/bandpass/bandstop IIR or FIR filter based on user input

What is (TO BE) plotted:
  - original signal in milivolts with adjusted time scale in seconds + PSD with estimated frequency
  - magnitude response of the filter
  - overlay of filtered signal on original signal

To be (EVEN BE-ER) implemented:
  - specified design methods rather than defaults
  - better scaling of output plots

What is actually here: 
  -hard-coded filter design and sampling analysis for given DSP assignment
