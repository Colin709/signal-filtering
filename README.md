# signal-filtering
Implemented in this repository:
  - Take user input and load a sampled signal
  - Calculate the sampling rate
  - design a lowpass/highpass/bandpass/bandstop IIR or FIR filter based on user input

What is plotted:
  - original signal in milivolts with adjusted time scale in seconds + PSD with estimated frequency
  - magnitude response of the filter
  - overlay of filtered signal on original signal

To be implemented:
  - butterworth and chebyshev filtering
  - better scaling of output plots
